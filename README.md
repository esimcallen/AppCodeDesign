# AppCodeDesign
Module Eight 

Journal Entry.

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

-The requirements of the app I created were to create a fully functional Event Planning application that will allow a user to sign in, create new events and delete them, and to have it supported by a grid and a functional database. My goal was to meet all those requirements. The user need this app was designed was to have a app where the user can track and manage upcoming events.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

-In order to support the users needs, their needed to be a screen where users can view all current events, add and remove them and view the calendar. In order to keep users in mind, I kept my UI simple and clean. The aesthetic was a calming sage and white color. My designs were successfull because they allowed users to complete their tasks without feeling overwhelmed due to too many elements.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

-In the process of coding my app, I tried to look back at all the previous information given in the textbook. I researched a ton and look at severeal documentations for code that I did not understand. In the future, I think looking at documentation is a great practice to apply, it gives you plenty of information and examples.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

-In order to test my code to ensure functionality, I created several "dummy" users. Thus was especially important in making sure the database was taking in usernames and passwords. This revealed that my database was infact funtional and running correctly.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

- I believe that I especially innovated when it came to the designing process. I am a terrible artist and not very creative at all. I had to research several designs and tweak them to my liking.


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

-I belive that I am on my way to being experienced in the design aspect of Android Studio. I still have a lot to learn, but towards the end of my project I felt more confident in the design than the actual code.
